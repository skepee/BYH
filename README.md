# Book your holidays

Book holidays is a simple page to plan your holidays.

Example with three different destinations, round trip to London or Edinburgh or Dublin, by using a datepicker to select start/end date. A carousel shows image of your destination and a show/hide description panel.

With show/hide panels to choose breakfast (only one) and sightseeing (up to three).
